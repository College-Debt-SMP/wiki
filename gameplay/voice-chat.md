# Proximity voice chat

The Simple Voice Chat mod allows players to do voice communication within in-game distances without using an external software such as Discord. This add more immersion to the multiplayer experience, but requires installation from each players who wished to use this feature.

## Installation

There are many ways and tutorials available to install the mod, but I will provide what I think is the simplest methods for all players.

1. Install the [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app)
2. Create a new profile. Alternatively, installing an optimization modpack is also recommended

## Control

These are the default keybinds for voice chat mod. You may change them in the control option.

* `M` - Mute/unmute the microphone.&#x20;
* `V` - Open the voice chat menu.
* `G` - Open the group chat menu.
* `H` - Hide/unhide the voice chat user interface element such as the microphone icon.
* `N` - Disable/enable voice chat. Disabling will also deafen any voice chat from other players.
