# Maintenance

A Minecraft server requires some level of up keeping. This page describe how the server are maintained.

## Backup

World backups are taking place at the following time:

* After a server restart at 12pm UTC or 4am PST
* At least 12 hours after a server restart (on or after 12am UTC or 4pm PST). If there are no players on the server, backup will only be made when someone join after that time

Up to 90 days of world backups are stored remotely [here](https://naturelovesalon.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/CollegeDebtSMPFiles/EonRARVvOyVOsittHcIxGucBDjn6ws1FA3vi-jXqC5xk9g?e=Agpf5T).

## Chunk pruning

On some occasions, the server admin will perform manual pruning to remove unused or seldom use chunks in order to conserve disk space. Chunk selections are done on a careful basis to not remove sections of the world that contains a noticeable level of progression. Players are free to point out to the server admin on which specific areas they want to keep.

## Minecraft update

Due to the server heavy reliance on community made project for custom features, there is usually a 1 month gap between an update release and server updating. Timeline will vary based on the progression on the mod/datapack developers. In some cases, update could take place earlier without all of the custom content be available at first until they're updated.
