# Play

If you're new to the server, then welcome! The College Debt SMP is a survival multiplayer (SMP) Minecraft server where you would play like in any survival world. Creativity are always encouraged.

## A vanilla+ server

The College Debt SMP is designated as a _vanilla+_ server. The term do have several different interpretations, but what it meant in this case is that the server has been modded in a way that expand upon the existing gameplay designs and features of vanilla Minecraft to provide more content while staying true to the look and feel of the base game. Players do not have to install any mods to play on the server unless they want to utilize certain optional features. Refer to the sections lower in the sidebar for the modded stuff.

## Play on Bedrock

You can also play on the server with the same inventory using the Bedrock Edition of the game on mobile devices, consoles, ChromeOS, and Windows 10/11 (titled "Minecraft for Windows"). Join using the same IP with the default port 19132.

You must authenticate with your Java Edition Microsoft account on each join. To have this information saved, provide the server admin your Xbox/Bedrock username.

Console players are required to have an active online subscription on their platform to play. As joining external server are disabled in the in-game menu, you must follow this [instruction](https://geysermc.org/wiki/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles).
