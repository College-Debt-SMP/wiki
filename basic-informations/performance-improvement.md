# Performance improvement

The vanilla Minecraft Java Edition client in general are very unoptimized. Though not required, all players are encouraged to install mods that can drastically improve the game performance even if you have a powerful system.

## Performance modpacks

These modpacks combine several different performance improvement mods together to optimize the game as much as possible. They can be downloaded directly on third-party launchers like Modrinth or Prism Launcher.

* With Optifine features: [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)
* Without Optifine features and slightly better performance: [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop)

## Optifine

You can still use Optifine with the latest version of Minecraft. However, it's not as effective as the later-released performance Fabric modpacks. Using Optifine is therefore no longer recommended, and it now has a direct drop-in replacement with full feature parity.
