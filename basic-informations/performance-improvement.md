# Performance improvement

Minecraft Java Edition client in general are unoptimized out of the box up to today. Though not required, all players are encouraged to use a modpack that can drastically improve the game performance for weaker systems including more powerful ones.

## Performance modpacks

These modpacks is a compilation of many different performance improvement mods to optimize the game as much as possible. They can be downloaded directly on third-party launchers like Modrinth or Prism Launcher. For manual installation with the default Minecraft Launcher, refer to guide on the internet.

* Without Optifine features but with slightly better performance: [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop)

## How about Optifine?

Optifine remains an option even for today. However, its effectiveness in optimizing the game has been long surpassed by the Fabric modpacks listed above. Optifine-compatible visual enhancements, like connected textures and shaders, are also available in some of them. For this reason, using Optifine will no longer yield the best result.
