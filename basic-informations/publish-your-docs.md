## Whitelist

Only whitelisted players can join and play on the server. If you're invited and have not played before, contact the server admin with your username.

## Item despawning

Any items dropped upon a player's death are not subjected to the 5 minutes despawn timer. They will remain until being picked up. This does not apply to item drops by other means.

## Chat Report

Chat reporting to Mojang Studio has been disabled on the server. To get rid of the warning message that shows up on every join, install the [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) mod or use any modpack that has it included.
