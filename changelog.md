<summary>Beyond Vanilla - 8/6/2024</summary>

Presenting the most unusual addition to the server up to date.

Ever since the beginning, the SMP has so far been a place where all of us would do two things: messing about and adventuring. We might be very bright minded with the first one even up to today, but the latter has become increasingly dry despite with the yearly game update. For this reason, time to go modded bois!

Before getting into the new stuff, here are the boring changes since updating to 1.21:

* Image2Map command is now available again
* Improve chunk loading speed by a bit
* The 1.21 preview datapack has been removed due to redundancy

Ok, now for the new stuff:

**Gameplay**

* You can now sit down. Simply do `/sit` while standing on any block, stair, or slab you wish to lay your butt on
* Craftable invisible item frame. Combine an Item Frame with Glass Pane to create. Useful for decorations

**World**

* You will now find new dungeons across biomes and dimensions to fight your way through to find possibly new enchantments. It’s trial chambers galore. You might need to get a drink first
* Other than houses waiting to kill you, you will also find simple structures around the world too
* Most biomes now received some subtle overhaul to spruce things up a bit. Same things for the nether
* Fireflies are now a thing. They’re just chilling, and frogs don’t eat them

**Combat**

* Ender Dragon got buffed with new abilities. Good luck lol.
* ~~All mobs, ranging from Zombies to Elder Guardian, got slightly buffed with longer sighting range. Also good luck lol~~ (Edit: temporarily disabled due to potential impact to redstone contraptions. Lmk if you want to try it out)

The main theme surrounding this “update” is to introduce more variety into the world while maintaining the overall theme of vanilla Minecraft. With new places to explore, it fills in the gap that the game has been missing for a while. Doing all of these in groups are recommended.

<summary>Armored Paws - 5/31/2024</summary>

The server is now on version 1.20.6; please update to this version before joining.

Temporarily unavailable features (will update throughout time):

* Certain custom features that uses datapack may not work.
* Carpet mod

Full change-log:

* Update the game version to 1.20.6
* Image2Map has been forked to “Image2Map E”. It’s the same mod, but with some custom modification to better suit server usage.
* Re-enabled server world backup.

**1.21 update note:** Due to the trial chamber won't be completely finalized until 1.21.1, upgrading will be postponed until the release of this minor update to ensure bug free generations. It likely won't be long after the initial release.

<summary>April server update - 4/5/2024</summary>

#### Highlight

* Bedrock support: Useful for when you're away from your PC, you can now join the server using the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft on any supported platform. Compatibility is not flawless, but is beyond playable. More info about playing on Bedrock [here](https://www.notion.so/Server-info-407e97beb438452c8bc93f41f75eb93a?pvs=21).
  * Known issue: Chunks may fail to load randomly unless you reload or go into a different dimension. If this happens, you may try to set your render distance to 24 or at least 6 above the server’s max value as a temporary work around.
* Image2Map tweaks:
  * Generating custom map now requires that you have enough empty map(s) in your inventory.
  * `/normalize <WIDTH>` command to allow easier image resizing in Minecraft blocks without changing the aspect ratio.
  * Generating bigger maps will no longer give you a bundle of maps, but instead individual maps.
  * Breaking a bigger map out of the item frame will no longer delete the entire thing and not giving any back.
  * Fix a bug where the custom maps will get automatically remove if the player’s inventory is full.

#### Full changelog

* Added the [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) mod for Bedrock support.
* Added the [Hurricane](https://modrinth.com/mod/hurricane) mod to improve Bedrock compatibility with the server.
* Update the Image2Map mod with a customized version.

<summary>A plentiful update - 3/13/2024</summary>

You can now do more things in Minecraft (at least on this server). This is not a Minecraft version update.
