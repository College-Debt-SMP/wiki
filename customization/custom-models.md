# Custom item models

Minecraft supports the ability to bind a custom-made texture or 3D models onto an existing item in the game. This feature is purely cosmetic, and is made possible with a resource pack - that is the reason why the game prompt you to download one upon joining the server.

While being niche in most use cases, it can provide another level of immersion in roleplaying and do look cool overall.

## Adding custom texture or model

As these assets are not available in the vanilla game, it must be obtained somewhere on the internet or self made.
